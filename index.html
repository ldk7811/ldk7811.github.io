<p>I attended South County High School in Virginia. There I got to learn a lot, and also learned one of my major hobbies, Dungeons and Dragons. Other hobbies of mine including messing with electronics, programming, playing games, and reading. I prefer to play games, but if I start reading I will read for hours at a time if I can't.</p>
